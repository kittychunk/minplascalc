    "### Tutorial 2: Adding a new diatomic species entry to your local data store\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to do calculations using a plasma species that you haven't used before, you will need to generate a minplascalc data entry for it first. You only need to do this <i>once</i> - minplascalc will store the species data in a plain-text file formatted using JSON syntax, and it will then be available for use in any of your future calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure for generating a minplascalc data entry for a new diatomic species is very manual since the data required must be retrieved from various locations. The majority of data for a wide range of species is available from the NIST Chemistry WebBook, http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/form-ser/. Enter the formula for the diatomic species you're interested in in the search box at the top of the page, and click the Search button. If you're looking for data for charged diatomic ions, make sure the \"Exclude ions from the search\" box is unchecked. Let's build a data entry for Silicon Monoxide, SiO:"

To get this, go back to the main page for SiO in the Chemistry WebBook and click on \"Constants of diatomic molecules\". This gives the parameters of various energetic states of the molecule - we want the ground state with energy $T_e$ = 0, so scroll all the way down to the entry at the very bottom:"

The vibrational constant $\\omega_e$ and rotational constant $B_e$ are read off the appropriate columns for the ground state entry. The symmetry constant $\\sigma_s$ takes the value of 1 for heteronuclear molecules like SiO, and 2 for homonuclear molecules like O<sub>2</sub>.

    "What's happening here? As before we import the minplascalc package, then we call a function to build and save the species data entry for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function takes as arguments the species name (which is also used as the data entry's associated file name), a small dictionary describing the elemental stoichiometry of the species (in this case one oxygen and one silicon), the molar mass in kg/mol, the charge on the species in units of the fundamental charge (in this case 0 because SiO is a neutral species), the ionisation and dissociation energies of the species in cm<sup>-1</sup>, and the electronic, vibrational, and rotational energy level parameters looked up from the Chemistry WebBook. Internally to minplascalc the function assembles the species information into a Python dictionary format, and writes it out to a JSON file called \"SiO.json\" on the path you're running this notebook from.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this process it will be possible to create an SiO species object in any minplascalc calculation by importing it using either the explicit path to the JSON file, or (preferably) just the name of the species provided the JSON file is stored in any of the standard minplascalc data paths - see later demos for examples."
