    "### Tutorial 2: Adding a new monatomic species entry to your local data store, the automatic way\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to do calculations using a plasma species that you haven't used before, you will need to generate a minplascalc data entry for it first. You only need to do this <i>once</i> - minplascalc will store the species data in a plain-text file formatted using JSON syntax, and it will then be available for use in any of your future calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For monatomic species minplascalc has built-in readers for handling data obtained from the energy levels section of NIST Atomic Spectra Database, which can be found at http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/levels_form.html. Since the format in which the ASD reports energy levels is fairly consistent, the data can be retrieved from the site using automated tools (special thanks to Carl Sandrock for contributing the scraping methods in the following code snippets)."
