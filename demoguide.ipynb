    "# Demo guide for package minplascalc\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to minplascalc, a Python 3 package to assist with calculations of equilibrium compositions and thermophysical properties of thermal plasmas of the sort typically encountered in metallurgical processing applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Target audience\n",
    "\n",
    "Plasma technology researchers and professionals with a basic knowledge of the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Ionised gases or <i>plasmas</i> are used in many industrial applications such as arc welding, plasma spraying, and electric furnace metallurgy. Engineering plasmas typically operate at atmospheric pressures and temperatures of the order of 10<sup>4</sup> K. Thermal plasmas of the sort considered here are assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibirum (LTE), meaning that a single unique temperature can be used to describe them (as opposed to two-temperature plasmas in which the electron temperature is distinct from the heavy-particle temperature). A major advantage of the LTE approximation is that all thermophysical properties of an equilibrium mixture of an arbitrary number of plasma species can be expressed as (complicated) functions of temperature and pressure only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge of these thermophysical properties is of great value to engineers working in plasma technology. Such information is useful for simple design calculations, and is necessary input data for computational fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics models of plasma systems. The calculation of composition and thence the thermophysical properties of a thermal plasma given some fundamental information about the species present is a well-understood but mathematically and numerically complex process - it is prone to error if performed manually, hence the need for this tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things you <b>can</b> calculate with minplascalc:\n",
    "* Statistical mechanics partition functions for individual species using information about the energy levels and excited states\n",
    "* Equilibrium plasma composition in terms of number densities of a specified mixture of species, using the principle of Gibbs free energy minimisation at a specified temperature and pressure\n",
    "* Density $\\rho$, (relative) enthalpy $H$, and heat capacity $C_P$ at equilibrium conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Things you <b>can't</b> calculate with minplascalc:\n",
    "* Compositions or thermophysical properties of two-temperature plasmas\n",
    "* $C_P$ for arbitrary non-LTE compositions\n",
    "* Plasmas of complex molecules or molecular ions consisting of more than two atoms\n",
    "* Plasmas involving negatively-charged ions\n",
    "* Transport or thermal radiation properties (see future versions though)\n",
    "\n",
    "The package also includes some basic tools to format and import data for individual species obtained from the NIST Atomic Spectra and Chemistry WebBook databases, and store it for use by future simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Worked examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of how to use various parts of the minplascalc package follows.\n",

Partition functions are generally presented as the sum of weighted state probabilities across the possible energy states of the system. In general at moderate plasma temperatures up to a few 10<sup>4</sup> K, a species' total partition function $Q_{tot}$ can be written as the product of several unique partition functions arising from different quantum mechanical phenomena (the weak-coupling approximation):\n",
