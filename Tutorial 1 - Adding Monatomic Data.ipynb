    "If you would like to do calculations using a plasma species that you haven't used before, you will need to generate a minplascalc data entry for it first. You only need to do this <i>once</i> - minplascalc will store the species data in a plain-text file formatted using JSON syntax, and it will then be available for use in any of your future calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For monatomic species minplascalc has built-in readers for handling data obtained from the energy levels section of NIST Atomic Spectra Database, which can be found at http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/levels_form.html. The landing page looks like this."

Internally to minplascalc the function reads the energy levels from the text file, assembles the species information into a Python dictionary format, and writes it out to a JSON file called \"O+.json\" on the path you're running this notebook from.\n",

    "After this process it will be possible to create an O<sup>+</sup> species object in any minplascalc calculation by importing it using either the explicit path to the JSON file, or (preferably) just the name of the species provided the JSON file is stored in any of the standard minplascalc data paths - see later tutorials for examples."
