    "This is really the reason that people will use minplascalc - to create mixtures of plasma species, and then do thermodynamic and thermophysical property calculations on those mixtures. The background machinery necessary to make this happen won't interest them overly much for the most part.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what defines a \"mixture\"? It's basically a group of plasma species that can interact and react thermodynamically with each other to form an equilibrium composition, just like any normal chemical mixture. In order to calculate the equilibrium composition (and hence all the other thermodynamic and thermophysical properties of interest, which depend on the composition) we need to tell minplascalc which species are present, the temperature and pressure, and some mass balance information to constrain the minimisation problem; this latter is generally given as an initial gas composition at room temperature or some similar standard condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical minplascalc user can be expected to be competent enough to know how to select all the species which are important to their particular problem, and spec an appropriate initial composition by mole fraction. We'd generally want to then proceed directly to doing property calculations using that mixture spec. At the moment we do this by creating an intermediate `mpc.Mixture` object which holds the species present as well as setting up some useful variables and placeholders for the Gibbs free energy minimisation calc. The Mixture object is currently generated from a JSON file which as discussed is probably dumb for a number of reasons - it would be cleaner to just use a standard Python data structure like a dictionary or similar, as shown in the following cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether the Mixture class actually needs to be exposed explicitly at all is also open to debate - perhaps it would be more transparent for the user to simply call the property calculation functions directly with the initial composition and state variables as arguments, with the `mpc.Mixture` object created internally as needed?"
