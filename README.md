### What is this repository for? ###

* You're here because you want to calculate LTE plasma compositions, thermodynamics, and physical and radiative properties. Some day this tool might be able to do all that, but for now you can use scraped content from the very nifty NIST internet databases, convert it to a pretty storage format, and run plasma composition calculations using it.
* Version 0.x alpha

### How do I get set up? ###

* Getting started: Clone into the repo. You'll get the module (MinPlasCalc.py) and some test drivers.
* Configuration: It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
* Dependencies: You will need an implementation of Python 3 (duh), and relatively recent versions of numpy and scipy.
* How to run tests: It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

### Contribution guidelines ###
