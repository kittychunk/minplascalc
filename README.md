# README #

A simple set of tools for doing calculations of thermal plasma compositions relevant to metallurgical problems using Python 3.

### What is this repository for? ###

* You're here because you want to calculate LTE plasma compositions, thermodynamics, and physical and radiative properties. One day this tool might be able to do all that :-), but for now you can scrape NIST data from their webpages, convert it to a pretty format, and run plasma composition calculations using it.
* Version 0.x alpha

### How do I get set up? ###

* Getting started: Clone into the repo. You'll get the module (ltePlasmaClasses.py) and some test drivers.
* Configuration: It is dark. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
* Dependencies: You will need an implementation of Python 3 (duh), and relatively recent versions of numpy and scipy.
* How to run tests: TBA
